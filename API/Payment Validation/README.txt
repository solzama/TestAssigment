    - Business logic: API/Payment_Validation/Controllers/ValidationController.cs, MainCheck method 
    Validation Controller returns one of two pages: errors in case of failure and card type in case of success. 
    For the ease od testing and example of use I also added a basic frontend.

    - Tests: API/UnitTests/ValidationControllerTests.cs
